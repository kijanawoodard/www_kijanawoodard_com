# The Journey

## 2021-09-30 8PM
Got side tracked for ... work.

Got an empty dotnet benchmark project installed. Was a bit surprised because it didn't "run" at first. Turns out someone updated the template a couple years ago, but the runnable version of the template is behind a flag: `--console-app`.

I ran the following to get a project:

`dotnet new benchmark -n Benchmarks --console-app`

Then I added it to the solution with:

`dotnet sln .\src\www_kijana_woodard_com.sln add .\src\Benchmarks\Benchmarks.csproj`

Finally, I successfully ran the benchmarks with:

`make benchmark`

Looking at Benchmark dotnet.
Looking at using Github Actions before netlify.

Getting a bit stuck in a decision loop.

Decided to go down the benchmark rabbit trail.

1. Needed to install the benchmark template first.
    1. `dotnet new benchmark --search` #just to see what the name is
    2. `dotnet new --install BenchmarkDotNet.Templates`
1. `dotnet new benchmark -n Benchmarks`

### Side Quest!
figuring out how to do nested lists in markdown and seeing the gap between common mark and what's implemented in previews for vscode. that would be a whole other rabbit trail to follow. not sure why two spaces for indentation of the nesting doesn't work. also want to have letters as the indented item label.

Ok. for lettering, it looks like I could just do that with css on the output. https://stackoverflow.com/a/61960060/214073

Finally! Made the first commit for my new blog engine.

This has been rattling around in my head for a while.

Before I get down into the details, I'll establish a little bit of structure. Makefile, tests, and get it running on netlify. Then I can build and push and iterate and have "something to show" all the time.

I'm going to attempt to follow trunk based development and write tests.

Welp! There's a snag. Was humming along and found out that netlify doesn't support dotnet core.

They maintain a "build image" and `dotnet` isn't on the supoprted list: https://github.com/netlify/build-image/blob/focal/included_software.md

It's been asked for, but no dice yet: https://answers.netlify.com/t/netlify-support-for-dotnet-core/21463

They don't seem to get that "dotnet" isn't "just webapps".

That's all well in good, but the build doesn't exactly "break" when you try to run a .net app. It just runs forever doing gcc tasks.

I sent them a support email:
<pre lang="txt">
Hello,

I started working on my own static site engine with dotnet 6.
I've used netlify for years and love it.

I didn't even _think_ about whether netlify "supported" dotnet. I figured it would just be there.

At any rate, I can see in the image repo that dotnet is not listed.

However, the build does....something.
I cancelled it after a while, but it looks like the process will just keep going.

You should probably find a way to kill this faster...
Or better yet, add dotnet to the list of supported languages/frameworks. ;-)

Here's a link to the build I cancelled:
https://app.netlify.com/sites/eager-gates-de1896/deploys/6155b0288dbe4e00083c30b0

Fwiw, my plan was to use `make run` to output to `src/site` and have index.html et al in there for netlify. That way, no matter how I triggered a deployment, everything would get built. For now, my plan is to remove src/site from .gitignore and not have a build on netlify at all.

Thank you,
